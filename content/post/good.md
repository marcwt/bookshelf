I read **Good to Great in January 2016**. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. 
Although this book is about how companies became great but we could apply a lot of the learnings on ourselves. 
Concepts like level 5 leader, hedgehog concept, the stockdale paradox are equally applicable to individuals.
